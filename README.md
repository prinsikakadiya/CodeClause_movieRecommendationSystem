**Overview**

This Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and past behavior. It utilizes a collaborative filtering technique to generate personalized recommendations for each user.

The system is built using machine learning algorithms and techniques, including matrix factorization and collaborative filtering. It learns from user ratings and builds a user-movie matrix, which is then used to calculate similarities between users or movies. These similarities are used to generate recommendations for each user based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in the Movie Recommendation System contains information about movies title,movies id, user id and user ratings.
